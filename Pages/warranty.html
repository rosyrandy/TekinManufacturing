		<br>
		If you are located outside the U.S. you should contact your supplier for service information. If you would like to send your unit to the U.S. for repair, we require a valid credit card number with the repair to begin work. In all cases, you must enclose a note or return card stating the problem, a legible return address and any special shipping instructions. We cannot return units to a P.O. Box unless payment (check or credit card number) is sent with the speed control. Hobby Dealers are not required to replace units thought to be defective, these units must be returned directly to the factory for repair.<br>

Most repairs are shipped back out in 2-5 working days, but can take up to 2 weeks depending on workload and if several different types of units are enclosed. Average total repair is $30.00, plus shipping. Prices on older units are slightly higher. Units that require replacement are higher. Some older units that have been out of production for a while are no longer serviced, and may require replacement. Please allow sufficient delivery time (up to 3 weeks). A service report will be included with the repair when it is returned to you.<br>

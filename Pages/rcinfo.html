					<td width="566%"><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,sans serif">Most Radio-Control (R/C) Race cars go between 25 and 35 miles per hour. They are powered by rechargable ni-cad batteries. Typical run time is 4-8 minutes, and recharge time is 30 minutes or less. Multiple batteries may be used for extended run time.</font>
						<p><font size="4">A transmitter is used to control the cars. There are usually two channels, one to control steering, and one to control throttle/brakes. The SPEED CONTROL installs inside the car. It connects to the motor, the batteries, and the radio receiver. The speed control links all these components together, and provides the signals required to drive the motor.The Tekin speed control supplies fully proportional throttle control from a low speed crawl, to wide open. When brakes are applied, the motor is shorted out to slow the car down, and flyback energy is stored to efficiently regenerate the braking power back into the battery pack.</font></p>
						<p><font size="4">The battery charger stays on the bench, It is used to provide a quick (under 30 minute) charge to the battery, with full maximum power possible, yet without overcharging. Careful science must be used in the charge process to obtain maximum performance. </font></p>
						<p><font size="4">Offroad style cars use minature oil-filled shock absorbers, DC electric motors, and molded rubber racing tires. Tekin quality cars are fully servicable when a part breaks.</font></p>
						<p><font size="4">On-road cars feature low center-of-gravity, and light weight composite construction.</font></p>
						<p><font size="4">Off-Road style cars feature independent suspension.</font></p>
						<p><font size="4">Some Tekin equipped cars go 0-60 MPH in less than 2 seconds, and briefly reach speeds of 105 MPH!<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font size="4">Each year, IFMAR, the International Federation of Model Auto Racing, sanctions the World Championship event. Drivers from around the world attend to find out who the fastest driver will be. The driving and competition is fierce, and final results are often not known until the very end.</font></p>
